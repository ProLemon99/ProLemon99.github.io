        <!-- OVERVIEW -->
        <section id="overview" class="section">
            <h2>What is Crime Fiction?</h2>
            <p>
                Crime fiction is a literary genre centered on criminal acts, investigations, motives, 
                and the search for truth. At its core, crime fiction places a mystery or other forms of 
                wrongdoings at the heart of the narrative. Readers follow detectives, law enforcement, 
                private investigators, journalists, or ordinary individuals who are drawn into the case.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most contemporary crime fiction stories nowadays are often associated with murders and high-stakes 
                investigations, but these stories are not limited and can explore a wide spectrum of crimes, from 
                theft and fraud to conspiracies and forms of psychological manipulation. The tension usually comes 
                from uncovering hidden truths, navigating clues and red herrings, and understanding what drives people to break the law.
            </p>
            <p>
                Crime fiction is also deeply psychological, as they often go into the depths of examining human nature, 
                morality, justice, and the darker aspects of society. Whether gritty and realistic or light and puzzle-driven, 
                the genre continues to evolve while remaining one of the most widely read categories in literature.

        <!-- HISTORY -->
        <section id="history" class="section">
            <h2>History of Crime Fiction</h2>

            <p>
                The history of crime fiction spans nearly two centuries, evolving from early detective tales 
                into a broad and diverse genre. Even without visual timelines, the development of crime fiction 
                can be understood through its major eras and influential works.
            </p>

            <h3>The Origins: Early to Mid-1800s</h3>
            <p>
                Many scholars credit Edgar Allan Poe as the father of detective fiction. His 1841 story 
                <em>The Murders in the Rue Morgue</em> introduced C. Auguste Dupin, the first fictional detective 
                to use logical reasoning and analysis, establishing the template for future sleuths. These early 
                tales set the foundation for mystery-driven narratives where intellect solves the crime.
            </p>

            <h3>The Golden Age (1920s-1930s)</h3>
            <p>
                The Golden Age of crime fiction produced intricate “whodunit” mysteries, often featuring 
                upper-class settings, clever puzzles, and a focus on fair-play clues. Authors like 
                Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, and G.K. Chesterton dominated this era. Christie's 
                Poirot and Miss Marple became iconic, and the rules of detective fiction were formalized 
                to ensure readers had a fair chance to solve the mystery.
            </p>

            <h3>Hard-Boiled and Noir (1930s-1950s)</h3>
            <p>
                In the United States, crime fiction took a darker turn. Crime became grittier, morally ambiguous, 
                and grounded in urban life. Writers such as Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler created 
                tough private investigators who navigated corrupt systems, dangerous criminals, and their own 
                personal flaws. This era prioritized atmosphere, cynicism, and realism over puzzle-solving.
            </p>

            <h3>Police Procedurals and the Modern Era (1950s-Present)</h3>
            <p>
                The rise of police-centered stories brought realism and detail into the genre. Authors like 
                Ed McBain helped popularize the police procedural, which followed law enforcement teams step-by-step 
                through an investigation. Modern crime fiction has continued to evolve, incorporating forensic science, 
                psychological profiling, global settings, and hybrid styles that blend crime with thriller, horror, 
                or true-crime influences.
            </p>

            <h3>Contemporary Crime Fiction</h3>
            <p>
                Today, crime fiction includes a wide range of voices and perspectives, including international 
                crime fiction, feminist crime novels, and works focused on social issues. Scandinavian “Nordic Noir” 
                has grown especially popular, known for bleak atmospheres and morally complex characters.
